# ============================================
# isA Platform - Test Environment (Complete Stack)
# ============================================
# All services in Docker with test ports (no conflicts with dev)
#
# Usage:
#   Full stack:        docker-compose -f docker-compose.test.yml up -d
#   Infrastructure:    ./scripts/start-test.sh infrastructure
#   Services only:     ./scripts/start-test.sh services
#   Phased startup:    ./scripts/start-test.sh up
#
# This file combines both infrastructure and services
# For phased startup, use docker-compose.test.infrastructure.yml and docker-compose.test.services.yml

include:
  - docker-compose.test.infrastructure.yml
  - docker-compose.test.services.yml

# All configuration is now in the included files
# This file is kept for convenience to start the full stack at once
